## What is it?
This site is my capstone project for the [Web Design For Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design) specialization offered by the University of Michigan and Coursera. I completed five courses over a period of 21 weeks to earn a [certificate.](https://coursera.org/share/903617d54a9ab0e149dbd43785b8c78a)

From the program description:
>This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible.

If you want to gain a firm understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, I highly recommend this specialization. The instructor, Colleen van Lent, Ph.D., is an excellent teacher.
